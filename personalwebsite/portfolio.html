      <h2> Computer Science Experience</h2>
      <p> 2020: Participated in Code in the Community, a Python workshop for low income students. Gained an understanding of the basic syntax of Python and wrote a chatbot using the language. In the same year, took part in a Goldman Sachs Telegram Chatbot workshop, and developed a movie bot using Python. </p>
      <p> 2021: Took part in National Olympiad of Informatics (NOI) training and learnt more about data structures, algorithms and graph theory in C++.</p>
      <p> 2022: Took up H2 Computing as an A-Level subject. In addition, I also attended various camps such as Kode with Klossy (where I coded an app in Swift), as well as Girls Who Code (where I coded a few Python chatbots and a HTML website). </p>
      <p> To further my learning, I have attended hackathons such as Lifehack 2022. I have also been learning new languages such as SQL and HTML/CSS/ReactJS.</p>
      <p> In addition, to give back to my community, I am volunteering with Code in the Community as an Assistant for their Level 2 Python classes.</p>
      <h2> Cybersecurity Experience </h2>
      <p> 2020: Completed the Youth Cyber Exploration Programme organised by Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA) and was invited to the Central Capture The Flag (CCTF) competition.</p>
      <p> 2021: Took part in more CTFs such as Siebbersec CTF, DSO-NUS CTF, CTF@SG. Also participated in Advanced YCEP, and learnt topics such as Advanced Linux and Windows.</p>
      <p> 2022: Joined the CTF interest group in Computer Science Society, with a focus on Forensics and maybe Reverse Engineering. Participated in Standcon and CDDC.</p>
      <h2> Research Experience </h2>
      <p> 2019: Physics School-Based Research Project titled ""</p>
      <p> 2020: Biology School-Based Research Project titled "Optimisation of algae based fertilisers for Brassica rapa var.parachinensis". </p>
      <p> 2021: Continued on the 2020 project, and submitted it for various competitions, such as Elementz Science Fair, where we earned a Bronze Award, as well as East Zone A*Star Science Fair.</p>
      <p> 2022: DSO Laboratories Research Project titled "Statistical Analysis of Cloud Encryption". This project would be presented at Research@YDSP Congress 2023, submitted for Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, as well as other conferences and competitions. This may also be published in a journal in conjunction with other papers.</p>
