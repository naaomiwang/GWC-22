    <h1 class = "Title"> Sentinel Programme Workshop 1</h1>
    <h4 class = "Date"> 13-14 June 2022</h4>
    <p> This workshop was held at Hwa Chong Institution and revolved around Web Vulnerabilities. Some content covered included SQL Injection and Cookies. The content taught is relatively basic (except for SQLI) but it's quite a nice refresher. </p>
    <p> However, I am quite excited for the other Sentinel Workshops such as OS and Network. </p>
    <h1 class = "Title"> Singapore Futures' Youth Competition </h1>
    <h4 class = "Date"> 6-9 June 2022</h4>
      <p> Won 1st place with my group! It was an extremelly fulfilling journey, researching about the current situation and coming up with future scenarios.</p>
      <p> In order to participate in this competition, I had to submit an essay about sustainability and what it means to me. I rushed mine an hour before the deadline and I was really surprised that I managed to finish it on time. I was quite hesistant to join due to the time commitment but I am so glad I decided to do so.</p>
      <p> The 5 days were quite tough, especially due to the hours spent staring at the screen, but my group was really productive and we managed to come up with a really good presentation and skit focusing on food sustainability.</p>
      <p> Overall, I am extremely glad to have had this chance to participate in this competition and learn more about public policy and futures thinking.</p>
